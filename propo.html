			<b>Abstract:</b> 
		Most contemporary Operating Systems (OSes) manage running instance of softwares such that all components
in the software are sharing the same virtual memory address space. This incurs a series of security
concerns as modern softwares are often heavily modularized with components imported from different untrusted
origins. Numerous research have shown that malicious actors are exploiting this design to steal secret data,
execute private code or conduct code-reuse attacks to escalate privilege. We refer to attacks that hinge on
illegal memory access to data or code that belong to other components (e.g., functions, modules, libraries, etc.)
executing in the same process context as <i>in-process memory abuse</i>.
In this thesis, I present three novel systems which provide multidimensional coverage for victim programs to
defend against in-process memory abuse. First, to protect sensitive data and code against malicious code that
manages to run in the same process context, I present Shreds, a set of OS-backed programming primitives and
a compiler-assisted toolchain to empower developers with fine-grained, convenient, and efficient protection of
sensitive memory content against in-process adversaries. Second, to protect valuable yet vulnerable components
from being directly exploited, I present Norax, a practical binary-rewriting system that retrofits executeonly
memory (XOM) into stripped commercial-off-the-shelf programs. Norax allows transformed programs to
leverage the new hardware-based XOM support–a feature widely available on AArch64 platforms yet virtually
unused due to the incompatibility of existing binaries. Deployed together with fine-grained randomization
protection, Norax provides a much stronger exploit mitigation than deployed defenses. Finally, to increase
the bar of in-process memory abuse, I propose Savior, a hybrid testing system designed for prioritization of
exploring buggy code and verification of bug existence. The strategies should yield a more complete detection
of bugs and significantly accelerated detection rate.
